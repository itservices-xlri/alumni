    <h2>Director's Message</h2>
    <h3>Fr S George, S J</h3>
    <p>XLRI has the unique distinction of being modern India's oldest business school; it was founded in 1949 by Jesuit Fr Quinn Enright, SJ, much before IIMs. He together with other Jesuit companions, worked diligently to build it. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the dedicated faculty, committed staff and loyal alumni over the last 70 years, today XLRI is ranked among the top business schools in the country and Asia.

        What differentiates XLRI from other business schools?
        
        I would like to mention four important hallmarks of Jesuit education which have guided XLRI in its successful journey and we will continue to place a strong emphasis on them.
        
        The first one is 'Excellence' (the first word you see on the Logo); it is the translation of the Latin word 'Magis'. In fact, the word 'Excellence' does not fully convey the true meaning of 'Magis';- it is to strive continuously for the best, without getting easily satisfied and without becoming complacent with our achievements.
        
        Along with Excellence, another word found on the Logo which describes the ethos of XLRI is Integrity. You cannot achieve excellence, long-term success without integrity and ethics. Excellence and Ethics are important elements of XLRI's DNA and they should also become part of the DNA of all of you, who pass through the portals of XLRI. These should be the important distinguishing factors of an XLRI alumni. This cannot be achieved by us, the faculty alone; it cannot be taught in the class room. We can help you to develop these attitudes, values and beliefs that form a managers' world view and a professional identity. We can show you the direction; but, you need to take responsibility to learn, to grow and to become responsible, committed and competent leaders.
        
        The third aspect relates to 'Whole-person growth in all quotients' - growth of an individual across intellectual, social, emotional and spiritual levels; and the fourth hallmark being 'social consciousness - to be sensitive to the needs of the less privileged around us. Our curriculum includes a compulsory course in Business Ethics and activities such as rural visits to help inculcate a sense of social responsibility, marked with compassion for the downtrodden and the needy.
        
        Rooted in Excellence and Integrity, XLRI is setting up world-class campuses in Jhajjar (Near Delhi), Navi Mumbai and Amravati in Andhra Pradesh. With this strategic expansion the institute looks forward to inspiring more young minds and creating more responsible business leaders.
        
        All our management-centric programmes are taught by renowned faculty members who are committed to delivering the curriculum effectively. Our flagship PGDM programmes - BM, HRM, GMP and Fellow Program - are regularly revised to enable students to meet transformational business challenges and expectations of the business world.
        
        The MDP and outreach programmes have helped thousands of junior, mid-level and senior executives across the country to update their knowledge base and skill-sets and help climb up the corporate career ladder.
        
        So, come explore excellence and be inspired at XLRI.
        
        God bless you!
        
        Fr S George, S J
        Director</p>
